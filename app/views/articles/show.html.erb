    <%# We can now update an article by visiting its edit page, e.g. http://localhost:3000/articles/1/edit %>
    <li><%= link_to "Edit", edit_article_path(@article) %></li>
    <%# method: :delete option causes the link to make a DELETE request instead of a GET request.
    The data: { confirm: "Are you sure?" } option causes a confirmation dialog to appear when the link is clicked.
    If the user cancels the dialog, the request is aborted.%>
    
    <%# Both of these options are powered by a feature of Rails called Unobtrusive JavaScript (UJS more info: https://guides.rubyonrails.org/working_with_javascript_in_rails.html).

<%# `create` method for association %>
    <%# use the create method on @article.comments to create and save the comment.
    This will automatically link the comment so that it belongs to that particular article %>
<h2>Comments</h2>
<%# render the partial in app/views/comments/_comment.html.erb once for each comment that is in the @article.comments collection. %>
    <%# As the render method iterates over the @article.comments collection,
    it assigns each comment to a local variable named the same as the partial, in this case comment,
    which is then available in the partial for us to show  %>
<%= render @article.comments %>

<h2>Add a comment:</h2>
<%# defines the form partial that creates a new comment by calling the CommentsController create action %>
<%# Rails is smart enough to spot the forward slash in that string and realize that you want to render the _form.html.erb file in the app/views/comments directory. %>
<%= render 'comments/form' %>
